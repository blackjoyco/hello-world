# hello-world

Hello all,

I'm Brandon, a serial entrepreneur and Jr. Developer from Miami, Fl. I am passionate about technologies such as JS, PHP, and SQL, and I am seeking to become familiar with modern programming paradigms. I want the world to be a better place, especially for communities of color.
